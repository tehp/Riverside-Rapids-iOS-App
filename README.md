PROJECT TITLE: Riverside iOS App
<hr>
###### What is your inspiration for this project?  Why did you choose to do it?  Why is it important to you?
We’ve noticed that a lot of students don’t have access to information about the school such as the Daily Announcements, the Bell Schedule etc. The Riverside Android app solves many of these problems for Android, but iOS users still don’t have anything to help them. This is important because these issues affect a lot of students and we think the app could be very helpful.

###### What is the overall goal of your project?
To create a useful app that will be utilized by students to make their time at riverside a little easier and more organized.  By the end of this project, we hope to have created a fully functioning ios version of the riverside app.

###### What prior knowledge or experience do you have with this topic?
None of us have any experience programming in Swift, and very little experience in the xcode environment. 


###### What do you need to learn in order to make this project successful?
We need to learn how to develop working with Swift in xcode, learn the cocoa framework, and how to debug using iOS.


###### Describe what your final product/program/app/etc would look like?
An IOS optimized version of the current Riverside android app to allow almost all phone users to have access to the school’s application 



###### How will your product be beneficial to those in the school or community?  
The app will provide easy access to the Daily Announcements which many students miss when their classes are too loud during lunch. It will also provide an up-to-date bell schedule so students will be aware when the schedule changes and when day 1 / day 2 is. Other features, time-dependant will include the school calendar, a map, push notifications and 

###### What resources do you need to complete this project?
Xcode version 6 or above. Macs.


###### What are some of the challenges or difficulties you could foresee happening with this project?
We may run into difficulty with resolving errors. None of us have experience debugging in Swift, so we could end up spending a lot of time browsing forums or stackoverflow to debug. 


###### Develop a clear action plan for the project:
What will be done?  When will it be done?  Who will do it?  How much will it cost?
